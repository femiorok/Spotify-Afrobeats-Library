# Spotify-Afrobeats-Library
A project based on Spotify's API to catalog it's afrobeats songs

This app requires a Spotify account for access. 

To install, a simple npm install command will install all the dependencies you need. You will also need to create your own client ID and secret env file,
which you can get from Spotify's developer dashboard. 

This project is actively in development and will soon be refactored and migrated to Next.JS.
